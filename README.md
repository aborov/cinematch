**Coding Conventions**

Please follow the [Ruby community Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/).

**Naming Conventions**

  - Use `snake_case` for variables, methods, and file names.
  - Use `PascalCase` for class and module names.
  - Reflect domain concepts accurately in naming. For instance, if you are working within a financial application, prefer names like `user_account_details` over vague terms like `data`.

**Design Principles**: Focus on Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
  - Organize code to reflect the domain model clearly.
  - Use service objects, decorators, and other design patterns that help isolate domain logic from application logic.

**Comments and Documentation**
- Comment your code where necessary to explain "why" something is done, not "what" is doneâ€”source code should be self-explanatory regarding the "what".
- Document methods and classes thoroughly, focusing on their roles within the domain model, especially for public APIs.

**Version Control Practices**
- Commit messages should be clear and follow best practices, such as those outlined in [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- Keep commits focused on a single issue to simplify future maintenance and troubleshooting.
