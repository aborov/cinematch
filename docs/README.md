## JRuby Service Documentation

The application uses a dual-runtime architecture with a separate JRuby service for memory-intensive background jobs. The following documentation is available:

1. [JRuby Render Setup Guide](jruby_render_setup.md) - Overview of the architecture, deployment process, and rationale behind using JRuby for memory-intensive jobs.

2. [JRuby Service Guide](jruby_service.md) - Technical troubleshooting guide with detailed information about the JRuby service, how it works, and how to debug issues.

## Using the Documentation

- If you're new to the JRuby service or need to understand the overall architecture, start with the [JRuby Render Setup Guide](jruby_render_setup.md).
- If you're experiencing issues with the JRuby service or need to debug job routing problems, refer to the [JRuby Service Guide](jruby_service.md).
